The only modifications to this formula was to use the surface area of the cloth instead of radius and to scale the drag force by the absolute value of the dot product between the pointMass normal and the wind vector. We take the absolute value of the dot product because the force from the wind should act in the same direction regardless of the orientation of the cloth face. There are still some things left to improve in our implementation of wind such as checking for objects in front of the cloth and setting the surface area of the boundary masses to be lower than the other masses.
