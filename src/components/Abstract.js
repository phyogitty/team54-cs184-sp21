        We thought Project 4 (Cloth Simulation) was very interesting and we
        wanted more. So, in this project, building on top of Project 4, we sped
        up the simulation time using multithreading disciplines. We also
        designed and simulated 6 different types of clothes with some
        interesting and some both interesting and realistics textures. Lastly,
        we implemented the wind effect demonstrated on the flag and visualized
        with the vector fields.
